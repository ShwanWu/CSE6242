Layout use "Force Atlas":
set "Repulsion strengh" to 23000, adjust by size. 
Compute "Average Path Length" and apply "Betweeness Centrallity" to node color.
Set the node size: min size of 40 and max size of 205 to the node. 
Also set the size of label of nodes proportional to the size of node.
Use Degree Range(>2) filter to display important nodes' labels.

For some unknown reason, I cannot show the label of each node when I refresh the graph and output it. Sorry for that.
